I’m a Master’s student in Big Data & Applied Statistics at Konkuk University, with hands-on experience in consumer insights and analytics. I enjoy turning real-world data into decisions—building models, validating assumptions, and communicating results to stakeholders.

My recent work focuses on predictive modeling, spatio-temporal analysis, and causal inference. I’m particularly interested in applying statistical reasoning to finance problems such as valuation drivers, forecasting, and decision support.

### Strengths
- Python, R, SQL  
- Statistical modeling & inference  
- Causal reasoning  
- Clear reporting & dashboards
