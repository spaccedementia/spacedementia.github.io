title: "Master’s Thesis: Median Polish Kriging on Irregular Domains"
permalink: /project-thesis/
---

### One-line summary  
Developed a robust spatial modeling workflow using Median Polish Kriging to handle trend and residual structure on irregular spatial domains.

---

### Problem  
Standard kriging methods can struggle with complex spatial trends and irregular domain shapes. This thesis explored a robust decomposition-based approach to improve spatial prediction and interpretability.

### Data  
- Spatial observations over irregular geographic regions  
- Coordinates with associated response measurements  
- Non-rectangular spatial domain

### Approach  
- Median polish to decompose global trend and residuals  
- Variogram modeling on residual spatial structure  
- Kriging for spatial prediction  
- Combination of trend and spatial components for final estimates

### Validation  
- Comparison against baseline kriging approaches  
- Prediction accuracy assessment  
- Visual inspection of prediction surfaces and residuals

### Results  
- Improved robustness to outliers and irregular trends  
- Clear separation between large-scale trend and local variation  
- Interpretable spatial prediction surfaces with uncertainty awareness

### What I would do next  
- Extend to fully spatio-temporal settings  
- Explore Bayesian formulations  
- Apply methodology to environmental or economic spatial data

### Artifacts  
- Thesis PDF (available upon request)  
- Presentation slides  
- Code snippets used for analysis
