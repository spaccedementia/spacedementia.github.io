### One-line summary  
Analyzed fine particulate matter (PM2.5) dynamics across space and time to identify seasonal patterns, spatial hotspots, and long-term trends.

### Problem  
Air pollution poses significant public health and policy challenges. The goal of this project was to model PM2.5 concentrations over time and across geographic locations, capturing both temporal seasonality and spatial dependence.

### Data  
- Environmental monitoring data (PM2.5 concentrations)  
- Multiple monitoring stations  
- Time span: multi-year (daily / monthly aggregation)  
- Spatial coordinates for each station

### Approach  
- Exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis  
- Time series decomposition to identify seasonal and trend components  
- Spatial smoothing and interpolation concepts  
- Regression-based modeling with spatial and temporal covariates

### Validation  
- Comparison of observed vs fitted values  
- Residual diagnostics across time and space  
- Sensitivity to smoothing and aggregation choices

### Results  
- Clear seasonal patterns in PM2.5 levels  
- Identification of persistent spatial hotspots  
- Improved understanding of spatial heterogeneity beyond simple temporal averages

### What I would do next  
- Extend to full spatio-temporal hierarchical models  
- Incorporate meteorological covariates  
- Quantify uncertainty in spatial predictions more explicitly

### Artifacts  
- Analysis notebooks  
- Visualization outputs (maps and trend plots)  
- Project report
